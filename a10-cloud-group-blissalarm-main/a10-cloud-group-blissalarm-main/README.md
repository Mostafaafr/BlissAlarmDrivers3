## Fill out your assignment answers below

Include all of your relevant source files in the Github repository. You can use Markdown to link GIF images if a video submission is required - or link to a publicly available website hosting the video.

## 1. OTAFU
* We downloaded the TestA.bin file from the server 
* Youtube Link: https://youtu.be/vXE8FULY28Q 

## 2. GPIO Function Timing
* In this part, I ran the test many times, by pressing more than 5 buttons and running the command five separate times. I took more tests than necessary in the video, but these were the times giving me 2.40ms average time to run the function. Itâ€™s worth noting I ran the test another time using a different pin and got 5.5ms average, and I fear something may be off in my hardware, but overall the time seems to be between 2 and 8ms. I just used 7 points from the many samples I took to calculate the average.
